      <P>1. <SPAN class=U>Purpose.</SPAN> To inform the workforce investment 
      system of the implementation of common performance measures for job 
      training and employment programs in 2004. 
      <P>2. <SPAN class=U>Background.</SPAN> In 2001, the President announced a 
      Management Agenda to improve the management and performance of the federal 
      government. One of the five government-wide goals, budget and performance 
      integration, emphasizes program effectiveness. As part of the President's 
      budget and performance integration initiative, the Office of Management 
      and Budget (OMB) has developed common performance measures for programs 
      with similar goals. In explaining this initiative, OMB has stated: 
      <P>
      <UL>"Such measures are not determinative of whether a program is 
        effective nor does such a comparison automatically mean one program is 
        necessarily better or worse than another. However, such measures help 
        raise important questions and can help managers improve certain aspects 
        of their programs. This information can then be used to inform decisions 
        about how to direct funding and how to improve performance in specific 
        programs."</UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>3. <SPAN class=U>Common Measures.</SPAN> In coordination with federal 
      agencies, OMB has developed uniform evaluation metrics, called "common 
      measures," for job training and employment programs as well as four 
      additional crosscutting, government-wide functions, including housing 
      assistance, wildland fire management, flood mitigation, and disaster 
      insurance. The common measures are intended to institute uniform 
      definitions for performance. The common measures for job training and 
      employment will be applied to 31 programs administered by six federal 
      agencies. Attachment A provides a list of covered programs. These programs 
      are expected to implement the common measures (begin information 
      collection and reporting) in 2004. <BR><BR><BR><BR>
      <CENTER><B>EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING ADMINISTRATION<BR>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 
      LABOR<BR>Washington, DC 20210<BR><BR><BR></B></CENTER><BR><BR>Four 
      performance measures for adults and four indicators for youth have been 
      established for job training and employment programs: <BR><BR><U>Adult 
      Measures</U> 
      <UL>
        <LI>Entered Employment - Percentage employed in the 1st quarter after 
        program exit. <BR>
        <LI>Retention - Percentage of those employed in the 1st quarter after 
        program exit that were still employed in the 2nd and 3rd quarters after 
        program exit. <BR>
        <LI>Earnings Increase - Percentage change in earnings: (i) 
        pre-registration to post-program and (ii) 1st quarter after exit to 3rd 
        quarter after exit. <BR>
        <LI>Efficiency - Annual cost per participant. </LI></UL><BR><BR><U>Youth 
      and Lifelong Learning Measures</U> 
      <UL>
        <LI>Placement in Employment or Education - Entered employment or 
        enrolled in education and/or training in the 1st quarter after program 
        exit. <BR>
        <LI>Attainment of a Degree or Certificate - Percentage of participants 
        that earned a diploma, GED or certificate. <BR>
        <LI>Literacy and Numeracy Gains - Attainment of literacy and numeracy 
        skills by participants. <BR>
        <LI>Efficiency - Annual cost per participant. </LI></UL><BR>Attachment B 
      further describes these measures. The common measures will affect the 
      current performance measurement systems of all covered programs. For 
      example, the following are some key differences between the common 
      measures and the current performance indicators for Workforce Investment 
      Act Title IB programs:<BR>
      <UL>
        <LI>Exclusive use of Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records - 
        supplemental sources of data will not be permitted for 
        employment-related measures. <BR>
        <LI>One set of indicators for both adult and dislocated worker programs. 
        <BR>
        <LI>Earnings measure for both adults and dislocated workers will be the 
        percentage change in earnings at two points - the 1st and 3rd quarters 
        after exit. The common measures do not include a wage replacement rate 
        for dislocated workers. <BR>
        <LI>One set of measures for youth - eliminates distinction between older 
        and younger youth. <BR>
        <LI>New cost efficiency indicator added to both adult and youth 
        measures. </LI></UL><BR>There are similar differences between the common 
      measures and the current performance indicators for Wagner-Peyser, Trade 
      Adjustment Assistance, and the other job training and employment programs 
      administered by ETA. <BR><BR>To the extent possible, ETA will 
      administratively implement the common measures within the existing 
      statutory framework to minimize reporting on multiple sets of measures. 
      For all covered programs, when current program indicators and common 
      measures are similar, the definitions of current indicators will be 
      replaced by the common measure definitions. For current program indicators 
      that are not comparable to the common measures, programs will continue to 
      report on the current indicators as well as the common 
      measures.<BR><BR>The Department will provide guidance and assistance to 
      the grantees and program operators in the implementation of these 
      measures. A workgroup of representatives from the federal agencies 
      implementing common measures for job training and employment programs has 
      been established by OMB. This workgroup will facilitate communication 
      among agencies and will serve as a forum to work on common implementation 
      issues. A notice providing a single set of instructions on implementing 
      the common measures for all covered programs administered by ETA will be 
      published in the <U>Federal</U> <U>Register</U> for public comment in 
      spring 2003. Final guidance on the implementation of common measures will 
      be published by fall 2003. 
      <P>5. <SPAN class=U>Action Required.</SPAN> Please make this information 
      available to appropriate program staff. 
      <P>6. <SPAN class=U>Inquiries.</SPAN> Questions regarding the common 
      measures should be directed to the appropriate regional office or grant 
      administrator.
