<BR><FONT face=verdana size=2>[1] For the TANF program, the Entered Employment 
numerator is "Of those who receive TANF cash assistance in a quarter, the number 
who became employed in that quarter after being unemployed in the previous 
quarter."<BR>[2] For the TANF program, the Entered Employment denominator is 
"The total number of unemployed TANF cash assistance recipients from the 
"previous quarter" identified in the numerator."<BR>[3] For the TANF program, 
the Retention in Employment numerator is "Of those who received TANF cash 
assistance and are employed in a quarter (Q-a), the number of adults who were 
employed one (Q-b) and two quarters (Q-c) later (regardless of TANF assistance 
status)."<BR>[4] For the TANF program, the Retention in Employment denominator 
is "The number of participants employed in Q-a."<BR>[5] For the TANF program, 
Earnings Increase Numerator 1 is "For those who received TANF cash assistance 
and who had earnings from employment in Q-a, their earnings in Q-a minus their 
earnings two quarters prior to being determined eligible for TANF cash 
assistance." Earnings Increase Numerator 2 is "For those who received TANF cash 
assistance and who had earnings from employment in Q-a, their earnings in Q-c 
minus their earnings in Q-a."<BR>[6] For the TANF program, Earnings Increase 
Denominator 1 is "TANF cash assistance recipients' earnings two quarters prior 
to being determined eligible for TANF cash assistance." Earnings Increase 
Denominator 2 is "TANF cash assistance recipients' earnings in Q-a. "<BR>[7] For 
the TANF program, the Efficiency numerator is "Total federal TANF and State 
Maintenance of Effort expenditures, as reported by the states, on work-related 
activities/expenses, transportation, and a proportional amount on administration 
and systems." <BR>[8] For the TANF program, the Efficiency denominator is 
"Number of adults receiving TANF."<BR>[9] "Not in Education" includes those 
participants who have completed high school or its equivalent and have not yet 
entered post-secondary education.<BR>[10] In the case of DOL programs, 
attainment of a degree/certificate will be determined within the one-year 
follow-up period that exists for those programs. In the case of ED programs, the 
completion rates for secondary and postsecondary vocational education are 
calculated by each State using a methodology and time period it 
determines.<BR><BR><B><U>General Notes:</U></B> <BR>A. The Adult Ed program 
includes participants with both employment and educational outcomes. As a 
result, the program will be measured under the Adult measures; however, the 
Department may opt to use the "Attainment" and "Literacy/Numeracy" measures from 
the Lifelong Learning measures in addition.<BR>B. The Voc ED program for 
Post-Sec. students includes participants with both employment and educational 
outcomes. As a result, the program will be measured under the Adult measures; 
however, the Department may opt to use the "Attainment" measure from the 
Lifelong Learning measures in addition.<BR>C. VA's Voc. Rehab. Program 
follows-up on cases for 60 days after placement before closing the case and 
declaring rehabilitated status. To be consistent with other programs in the job 
training common measures, VA will use the date of employment as the program exit 
point. <BR>D. Education's VocRehab: an employment outcome is defined as 
competitive employment (at least the minimum wage) in the integrated labor 
market, and other outcomes as determined by the secretary, which include 
homemakers/unpaid family workers.<BR>E. Tribal programs will move toward use of 
UI wage records. In the mean time, there may be some reliance on administrative 
records as tribes make the shift to UI wage records.<BR>F. Where UI Wage Records 
are cited as the data set, UI records are either the sole source of data or the 
source against which administrative records must be verified.<BR>G. All programs 
will need to use a unique client identifier that can calculate the unduplicated 
count of program participation but it will not specify what that identifier is.
